Objective:

Climb to the top as fast as possible to obtain the best score. Although you could try to play this with one haptic device (good luck :) ) it would be best to use two here.

Instructions:

The menu in console shows many different keys you will need. To start the game, press R once you are ready to grab on to the cliff (we assume that you simply won't drift upwards since we know you are trustworthy :) )
Pressing R will apply workspace gravity so becareful.

If you reach the top you win, but be warned, you have a finite amount of lives. You will lose a life if you reach a point below the cliff such that it is impossible to climb back up.

Make sure that this project is run in release x64, no testing was done in the debug mode or in x86 either. 

Have fun and try not to get too sore. :)
